This is the backend of the Face Recognition app on my Github account.

The backend was developed as an Express app that interacts with a postGresSQL database. It encrypts the passwords of the users and stores as a hash field. Several modules are used including:
- bcrypt-nodejs
- cors
- knex.js

Thanks for having a look!
